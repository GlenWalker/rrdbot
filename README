This is a fork of RRDBot.

Original version can be found here:
http://thewalter.net/stef/software/rrdbot/

This repository contains minor bug fixes and enhancements to RRDBot made by REANNZ and others.
Notably, the daemon is now capable of writing raw counter values to a plain text file.
This is particularly useful if values without rrd's rate calculation and interpolation are required.
